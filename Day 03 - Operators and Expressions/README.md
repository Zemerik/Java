# Day 03 - Operators and Expressions

## 📚 What You'll Learn Today

- Understanding different types of operators in Java
- Learning arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- Understanding operator precedence and associativity
- Working with expressions and calculations
- Using assignment operators and shortcuts

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Types of Operators
1. **Arithmetic Operators**: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
2. **Relational Operators**: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
3. **Logical Operators**: &&, ||, !
4. **Assignment Operators**: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
5. **Bitwise Operators**: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>

### Operator Precedence
Operators have different levels of precedence:
1. Postfix: ++, --
2. Unary: +, -, !, ~
3. Multiplicative: *, /, %
4. Additive: +, -
5. Shift: <<, >>, >>>
6. Relational: <, <=, >, >=
7. Equality: ==, !=
8. Logical AND: &&
9. Logical OR: ||
10. Assignment: =, +=, -=, etc.

### Expressions
Expressions are combinations of variables, operators, and method calls that produce a value.

## 📁 Files in This Day

1. **ArithmeticOperators.java** - Basic arithmetic operations
2. **RelationalOperators.java** - Comparison operators
3. **LogicalOperators.java** - Logical operations
4. **OperatorPrecedence.java** - Understanding precedence

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile: `javac ArithmeticOperators.java`
2. Run: `java ArithmeticOperators`

## 💡 Exercises

1. Create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic
2. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd
3. Calculate the area and perimeter of different shapes
4. Create a temperature converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit)

## 🔍 Important Notes

- **Integer Division**: 5 / 2 = 2 (not 2.5)
- **Modulo Operator**: Returns remainder of division
- **Short-circuit Evaluation**: && and || stop evaluating when result is determined
- **Type Promotion**: Smaller types are promoted to larger types in expressions
