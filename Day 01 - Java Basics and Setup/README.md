### What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that runs on billions of devices. It's known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability.

### Java Program Structure
Every Java program has these essential components:
- **Class declaration**: `public class ClassName`
- **Main method**: Entry point of the program
- **Statements**: Instructions that perform actions

### Basic Syntax Rules
- Java is case-sensitive
- Statements end with semicolons (;)
- Code blocks are enclosed in curly braces {}
- File name must match the public class name
