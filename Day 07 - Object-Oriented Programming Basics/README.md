# Day 07 - Object-Oriented Programming Basics

## 📚 What You'll Learn Today

- Understanding classes and objects
- Learning about constructors
- Understanding access modifiers
- Working with instance variables and methods
- Understanding encapsulation principles

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Classes and Objects
- **Class**: Blueprint or template for creating objects
- **Object**: Instance of a class with state and behavior
- **State**: Data stored in instance variables
- **Behavior**: Actions performed by methods

### Constructors
- Special methods called when creating objects
- Same name as class, no return type
- Initialize object state
- Can be overloaded

### Access Modifiers
- **public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **private**: Accessible only within the class
- **protected**: Accessible within package and subclasses
- **default**: Accessible only within package

### Encapsulation
- Bundling data and methods that operate on that data
- Data hiding through private access
- Controlled access through public methods

## 📁 Files in This Day

1. **ClassAndObject.java** - Basic class and object creation
2. **Constructors.java** - Constructor examples
3. **AccessModifiers.java** - Access modifier demonstration
4. **Encapsulation.java** - Encapsulation principles

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile: `javac ClassAndObject.java`
2. Run: `java ClassAndObject`

## 💡 Exercises

1. Create a Student class with properties and methods
2. Build a BankAccount class with deposit/withdraw methods
3. Create a Rectangle class with area and perimeter methods
4. Implement a Car class with various properties

## 🔍 Important Notes

- **Naming**: Class names start with capital letter
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one purpose
- **Encapsulation**: Use private fields with public getters/setters
- **Constructors**: Always provide constructors for your classes
