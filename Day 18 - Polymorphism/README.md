# Day 18 - Polymorphism

## 📚 What You'll Learn Today

- What is polymorphism?
- Compile-time vs runtime polymorphism
- Upcasting and downcasting
- Benefits of polymorphism

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Polymorphism**: Many forms
- **Upcasting**: Parent reference to child object
- **Downcasting**: Child reference from parent object

## 📁 Files in This Day

1. **PolymorphismDemo.java** - Example of basic polymorphism
2. **PolymorphismMethodDemo.java** - Demonstrates polymorphism in method parameters and return types
3. **UpcastingDowncastingDemo.java** - Shows upcasting and downcasting with instanceof checks

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile: `javac PolymorphismDemo.java PolymorphismMethodDemo.java UpcastingDowncastingDemo.java`
2. Run: `java PolymorphismDemo` (or the other classes)

## 💡 Exercises

1. Demonstrate upcasting and downcasting
2. Use polymorphism in a method
