## 📚 What You'll Learn Today

- What are static variables and methods?
- Static blocks
- Static vs instance members

- **static block**: Runs once when class loads

## 📁 Files in This Day

1. **StaticDemo.java** - Example of static members
2. **StaticCounterDemo.java** - Demonstrates a static counter shared by all instances
3. **StaticUtilityDemo.java** - Shows static utility methods for math operations
4. **StaticBlockDemo.java** - Demonstrates the use of a static block for class initialization

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile: `javac *.java`
2. Run: `java StaticDemo` (or any of the other classes)

## 💡 Exercises

1. Create a class with a static counter
2. Use static methods for utility functions
3. Observe when static blocks are executed
